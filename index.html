      Hello! My name is <span class="nahian">Nahian.</span> Literally no one cares about this. So I made this painting app in Microsoft Small basic. It is a very simple app with CGA (<span class="color">Color</span> <span class="graphics">Graphics</span> <span class="adapter">Adapter</span>) and other colors. I don't know why I chose those colors but it exists. Also I have some background colors and pensize stuff that literally every painting app uses. so check it out then.
